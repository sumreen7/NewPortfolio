      background: "Hey! I'm Sumreen, originally from Hyderabad and currently at Carnegie Mellon pursuing my Master's in Information Systems. I spent two years at Salesforce as a Software Engineer building AI-powered automation workflows — think Agentforce agents, Slack bots, and onboarding systems used by 40K+ enterprise users. Now I'm channeling that technical depth into product management, combining my engineering roots with a passion for data-driven decision making and user-centered design.",
      interests: "Outside of work and school, I'm someone who loves exploring new places and cultures — travel is genuinely my reset button. I'm also into keeping up with the latest in AI and tech, and I enjoy diving into competitive strategy whether that's in product thinking or just life in general. Ask me about my YOMIGO travel project and you'll see how those two worlds collide!",
