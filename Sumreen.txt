Professional Summary
I'm Sumreen — a software engineer, data scientist, and builder with a product mindset. I've spent 2+ years at Salesforce shipping agentic AI workflows for enterprise-scale systems, and I'm currently at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing my Master's in Information Systems Management (Business Intelligence & Data Analytics). On the side, I'm building Naviyo, an adaptive AI travel assistant that personalizes itineraries in real time.

I sit at the intersection of engineering, AI, and product thinking — I care about building things that actually work and actually matter.

At Carnegie Mellon University, my focus as a graduate student is on Business Intelligence & Data Analytics — exploring how AI, data systems, and product thinking come together to build things that actually matter.
Previously at Salesforce, I led the design and rollout of agentic AI workflows for enterprise asset management, where my work reduced onboarding time by 40% and eliminated significant manual effort across pipelines serving 40K+ users. Working at that scale taught me how to think in systems — and how to ship work that holds up under pressure.
This experience, combined with a published research background in ML and hands-on startup building with Naviyo, drives me to keep pushing at the intersection of engineering, AI, and product — building solutions that are both technically rigorous and genuinely useful.
